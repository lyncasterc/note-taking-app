TO DO: 
    Update CSS
        Maybe make the notes look more like sticky notes? 
        Change color scheme altogether.
        Search bar and buttons need some styling.
    Update HTML Layout
        Have a base note that is clickable. When clicked allows new notes to be created.
            Same note base with something like this in center: https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/stroke/53/Button-512.png
        Integrate search bar in background of notes section?
        Add a pencil in the upper right of notes to allow editing: http://simpleicon.com/wp-content/uploads/pencil.png
            Reopens the create note section, but has the current text.
    Fix note text overflow
        If notes are too long, text overflows the div.
        Shrink text to fit div?
